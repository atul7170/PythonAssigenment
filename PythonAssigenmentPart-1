Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ans->  we call python as general purpose and high-level programmimg language because we can write everything in readable form, The logic and variable we can writting such way which is human readable form.

 
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans->  Python is strongly typed as the interpreter keeps track of all variables types. It's also very dynamic as it rarely uses what it knows to limit variable usage.Python is an interpreted, statically-typed programming language that allows both object-oriented and procedural programming.  Variables do not have to be assigned a type, such as “integer”, when they are first used. Python determines the type of variable at run time. Python uses a technique known as “duck typing”. It assigns a type to a variable depending on its value and how it is used. Python allows a variable to change type dynamically over the duration of the program.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
ans-> python pros :- 

1.Ease of Use
2.Gentle Learning Curve
3.Versatility
4.Efficient for Rapid Development
5.True Portability
6.No Compile Process
7.Automatic Memory Allocation
8.Extensive Built-In Objects and Libraries
9.Third-Party Library Availability
10.Open Source and Free to Use

python cons:-

1.Not Very Fast
2.Memory Intensive
3.Harder to Avoid Runtime Errors
4.Not Much Traction in Mobile or Desktop Applications
5.Not Optimized for Database Access
6.No Multithreading Support


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
ans-> Since Python is the go-to programming language for domains such as Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Computing Scripting, Networking, Game Development to Web Development.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ans -> variable is name given to a specific memory location and we can declare first variable name then operator and after the there is value. eg; x=5 -> x is variable name, = is operator, 5 is value .


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

ans-> following steps that can use for taking input from users in python
     1.Any variable name should start with alphabet
     2.We can not use any special symbol in variable
     3.we can only use underscore (_) as part of variable name.
     4. Any variable name can start from underscore.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ans-> The input() function always returns a string. If you want it to be some other type, you'll need to manually convert it.


Q8. What is type casting?
ans-> The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ans-> yes we can take more than one input from the user using single input() function.


Q10. What are keywords?
ans-> Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
ans-> We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
ans-> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ans-> declare variable name with value using operator and use "print()" function which might or might not accept some parameters.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
ans-> In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands. operators are- 1.numeric oprator 2.assignment operator 3.comparision operators  4.logical operator.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
ans-> / -> Use for for float division and // -> use for intger division .


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
    iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

ans-> str_data = 'iNeuron' * 4
      print(str_data)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
ans-> 
num = int ( input("Enter any number to test whether it is odd or even -"))
if (num % 2) ==0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The provided number is  odd")



Q18. What are boolean operator?
ans-> Python has three Boolean operators, or logical operators: and , or , and not .

Q19. What will the output of the following?
ans->
1 or 0 -> 1
0 and 0 -> 0
True and False and True -> False
1 or 0 or 0 -> 1


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
ans-> Conditional statements (if, else, and elif) are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions that you specify.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ans-> The first form 'if' test all conditions, whereas the second if-elif-else tests only as many as needed: if it finds one condition that is True, it stops and doesn't evaluate the rest. In other words: if-elif-else is used when the conditions are mutually exclusive.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
ans->

 age = int(input("Enter you age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote") 


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50] 

ans->
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
add = 0
for num in numbers:
  if num%2 == 0:
    add = add+num
  else:
    continue
print(add) 


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
ans->
 x, y, z = input("Enter 3 numbers seprated by comma: ").split(",")
if int(x) > int(y) and int(x) > int(z):
  print(f"{x} is greatest")
elif int(y) > int(z):
  print(f"{y} is greatest")
else:
  print(f"{z} is greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five

If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

ans->
 numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
lst = []
for num in numbers:
  if num > 150:
    if num > 500:
      break
  elif num%5==0:
    lst.append(num) 

print(lst)
